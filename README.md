# CNRMppe_error_decomposition

This repository contains the data files and code for the analyses presented in the paper :

**Title**: Adressing discrepancy in the calibration of a climate model \
**Author(s)**: Saloua Peatier, Benjamin M. Sanderson, and Laurent Terray \
**Special issue**: Theoretical and computational aspects of ensemble design, implementation, and interpretation in climate science (ESD/GMD/NPG inter-journal SI) 

Short description of the folders :

* **EOF** : to perform the EOF analysis, produce Principal Components

* **Error_decompo** : to produce Figures 1, 2 and 5 of the paper 

* **Correlation examples** : to produce Figure 6 of the paper 

* **Clustering** : to select candidates in both applications using clustering methods 

* **Analysis_candidates** : to analysis candidates results (both statistical emulations and climate model outputs) 

* **Emulator_skill** : statistical model evaluation, results discussed in Appendix C of the paper
